    "## Conclusion & Interpretation\n",
    "The calculated Atom Economy of **25.61%** for this Wittig reaction is exceptionally low. This result provides a powerful lesson in green chemistry:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High Potential for Waste**: An atom economy of 25.61% means that, even if the reaction yield were a perfect 100%, **nearly 75% of the total mass of the reactants is converted into waste byproducts**, not the desired methylenecyclohexane.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identifying the Source**: The primary reason for this inefficiency is the stoichiometric use of the Wittig reagent (`C19H18P`). After delivering a single carbon atom (`CH2`) to the final product, the rest of the reagent becomes the large, high-molecular-weight byproduct, triphenylphosphine oxide (`C18H15OP`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Takeaway**: This example perfectly illustrates why Atom Economy is a fundamental metric for green chemistry. It immediately flags a synthesis as inherently wasteful and pushes chemists to ask critical questions: \"Can we design a catalytic reaction or use a different synthetic route that avoids generating such a massive byproduct?\" This metric forces us to think beyond just reaction yield and focus on the intrinsic efficiency of a chemical transformation.\n",
