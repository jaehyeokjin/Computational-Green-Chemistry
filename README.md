# An Interactive Course in Computational Green Chemistry

## About This Material
This repository contains a collection of interactive, open-source Jupyter Notebooks designed to teach and apply the core principles of green and sustainable chemistry. Developed as part of a research initiative to create modern pedagogical tools, this toolkit provides students and researchers with accessible, hands-on methods for evaluating the sustainability of chemical processes. The concepts and tools presented here were originally developed for a short lecture and interactive session series during 2024-2025.

The primary goal is to provide a hands-on, inquiry-based learning experience that bridges the gap between the theoretical principles of green chemistry and their practical, quantitative application. By using computational tools, students can directly engage with concepts like reaction efficiency, waste minimization, and energy-efficient design in a tangible way.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Calculations:** Move beyond static examples with tools that allow you to input your own reaction data.  
- **Educational Focus:** Each notebook includes clear explanations of the underlying green chemistry principles.  
- **Minimal Setup:** Run all tools directly in your browser using Binder or Google Colabâ€”no local installation required.  
- **Open-Source:** The code is transparent and available for extension and modification by the community.  

## The Toolkit in Detail
Below is a summary of the computational tools available in this repository.

### 1. Atom Economy Calculator
**Principle:** Measures the theoretical efficiency of a reaction by calculating the percentage of reactant atoms incorporated into the desired product.  

- View on GitHub: `1_Atom_Economy_Calculator.ipynb`  
- Run Interactively:  

### 2. E-Factor (Environmental Factor) Calculator
**Principle:** Quantifies the actual waste generated by a process, offering a practical measure of its environmental impact.  

- View on GitHub: `2_E-Factor_Calculator.ipynb`  
- Run Interactively:  

### 3. Process Mass Intensity (PMI) Calculator
**Principle:** A holistic metric that evaluates the total mass of all materials (reactants, solvents, workup chemicals) used to produce a specific mass of product.  

- View on GitHub: `3_PMI_Calculator.ipynb`  
- Run Interactively:  

### 4. Simple Solvent Selection Guide
**Principle:** A guide for making informed choices about solvents based on simplified safety, health, and environmental criteria.  

- View on GitHub: `4_Solvent_Selection_Guide.ipynb`  
- Run Interactively:  

### 5. Reagent Hazard Assessment Tool
**Principle:** A tool to compare the inherent hazards of different synthetic routes by scoring reagents based on their GHS pictograms.  

- View on GitHub: `5_Reagent_Hazard_Assessment.ipynb`  
- Run Interactively:  

### 6. MD Tutorial for Green Chemistry with Hands-on Tutorial
- Will be updated

## Getting Started
### Option 1: Run Online (Recommended)
Click the **Binder** or **Colab** badges next to any tool above to launch it in a free, interactive, cloud-based environment. There is no need to install any software.

### Option 2: Run Locally
To run these notebooks on your own machine, you will need Python 3 and Jupyter.

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaehyeokjin/Computational-Green-Chemistry
cd Computational-Green-Chemistry
```
Install the required packages:
```
pip install jupyterlab pandas molmass
```
Launch JupyterLab:
```
jupyter lab
```
This will open a new tab in your web browser where you can navigate to and run the notebooks.

**Future Work**
This toolkit is an ongoing project. Future directions include:
- Developing additional modules for other metrics (e.g., Reaction Mass Efficiency, Life Cycle Assessment data).
- Integrating predictive models for chemical toxicity and biodegradability.
- Building a web-based user interface using Voila or Streamlit to further increase accessibility for users without a programming background.
