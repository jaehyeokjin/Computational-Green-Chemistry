# A Computational Toolkit for Green & Sustainable Chemistry

## About This Project
This repository contains a collection of interactive, open-source Jupyter Notebooks designed to teach and apply the core principles of green and sustainable chemistry. Developed as part of a research initiative to create modern pedagogical tools, this toolkit provides students and researchers with accessible, hands-on methods for evaluating the sustainability of chemical processes. The concepts and tools presented here were originally developed for a short lecture and interactive session series during the 2024–2025 academic year.

The primary goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical green chemistry concepts and their practical, quantitative application, fostering a deeper understanding of how to design safer, more efficient, and environmentally benign chemical reactions.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Calculations:** Move beyond static examples with tools that allow you to input your own reaction data.  
- **Educational Focus:** Each notebook includes clear explanations of the underlying green chemistry principles.  
- **Minimal Setup:** Run all tools directly in your browser using Binder or Google Colab—no local installation required.  
- **Open-Source:** The code is transparent and available for extension and modification by the community.  

## The Toolkit in Detail
Below is a summary of the computational tools available in this repository.

### 1. Atom Economy Calculator
**Principle:** Measures the theoretical efficiency of a reaction by calculating the percentage of reactant atoms incorporated into the desired product.  

- View on GitHub: `1_Atom_Economy_Calculator.ipynb`  
- Run Interactively:  

### 2. E-Factor (Environmental Factor) Calculator
**Principle:** Quantifies the actual waste generated by a process, offering a practical measure of its environmental impact.  

- View on GitHub: `2_E-Factor_Calculator.ipynb`  
- Run Interactively:  

### 3. Process Mass Intensity (PMI) Calculator
**Principle:** A holistic metric that evaluates the total mass of all materials (reactants, solvents, workup chemicals) used to produce a specific mass of product.  

- View on GitHub: `3_PMI_Calculator.ipynb`  
- Run Interactively:  

### 4. Simple Solvent Selection Guide
**Principle:** A guide for making informed choices about solvents based on simplified safety, health, and environmental criteria.  

- View on GitHub: `4_Solvent_Selection_Guide.ipynb`  
- Run Interactively:  

### 5. Reagent Hazard Assessment Tool
**Principle:** A tool to compare the inherent hazards of different synthetic routes by scoring reagents based on their GHS pictograms.  

- View on GitHub: `5_Reagent_Hazard_Assessment.ipynb`  
- Run Interactively:  

### 6. MD Tutorial for Green Chemistry with Hands-on Tutorial
- Will be updated

## Getting Started
### Option 1: Run Online (Recommended)
Click the **Binder** or **Colab** badges next to any tool above to launch it in a free, interactive, cloud-based environment. There is no need to install any software.

### Option 2: Run Locally
To run these notebooks on your own machine, you will need Python 3 and Jupyter.

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaehyeokjin/Computational-Green-Chemistry
cd Computational-Green-Chemistry
```
Install the required packages:
```
pip install jupyterlab pandas molmass
```
Launch JupyterLab:
```
jupyter lab
```
This will open a new tab in your web browser where you can navigate to and run the notebooks.

**Future Work**
This toolkit is an ongoing project. Future directions include:
- Developing additional modules for other metrics (e.g., Reaction Mass Efficiency, Life Cycle Assessment data).
- Integrating predictive models for chemical toxicity and biodegradability.
- Building a web-based user interface using Voila or Streamlit to further increase accessibility for users without a programming background.
