    "# Green Chemistry Toolkit: 4. A Simple Solvent Selection Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principle 5: Safer Solvents and Auxiliaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Solvents account for the vast majority of mass in a typical chemical reaction and are a primary driver of its environmental impact. Choosing a safer, more sustainable solvent is one of the most effective ways to make a process greener.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Goal:** Minimize the use of auxiliary substances (like solvents). When they are necessary, choose the safest and most environmentally benign options available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How This Tool Works\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide uses a simplified scoring system inspired by industrial solvent selection guides (like those from GSK and Sanofi). It ranks common lab solvents across three categories:\n",
    "1.  **Safety:** Flammability, reactivity, etc.\n",
    "2.  **Health:** Toxicity, carcinogenicity, etc.\n",
    "3.  **Environment:** Persistence, aquatic toxicity, VOC potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scores are on a scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best). A higher **Overall Score** indicates a greener choice."

    "### Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python code below automates the ranking process using the `pandas` library, a standard tool for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Data Storage:** The scores for each solvent are stored in a Python dictionary called `solvent_data`.\n",
    "2.  **DataFrame Creation:** `pandas` is used to convert this dictionary into a structured table (a DataFrame), which is easy to manipulate.\n",
    "3.  **Calculation:** A new 'Overall Score' column is calculated by taking the average of the 'Safety', 'Health', and 'Env.' columns for each solvent.\n",
    "4.  **Ranking:** The table is then sorted by this 'Overall Score' from highest to lowest to create the final ranking.\n",
    "5.  **Formatting:** A helper function, `color_score`, is used to add ANSI color codes to the output. This makes the final table more intuitive by visually highlighting the green, yellow, and red categories, allowing for a quick and clear assessment."

    "### Conclusion & Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the Solvent Selection Guide provides a clear, data-driven hierarchy for making greener chemical choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The \"Green\" Tier:** Unsurprisingly, **Water** is the ideal green solvent with a perfect score. **Ethanol** and **Isopropanol** are also highly recommended, scoring well across all categories. These solvents are generally preferred as they are less toxic, derived from renewable resources (bio-ethanol), and have a lower environmental impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **The \"Yellow\" Tier:** Solvents like **Acetone** and **Heptane** fall into a cautionary middle ground. While acetone has favorable health and safety scores, its environmental score is lower due to its high volatility (VOC potential). Heptane is a classic example of a trade-off: it has moderate health and environmental concerns but a poor safety score due to its high flammability. This tier highlights that solvent choice is often about balancing competing factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **The \"Red\" Tier:** The guide strongly discourages the use of solvents at the bottom of the list. **Dichloromethane (DCM)** and **Chloroform** are flagged for significant health risks (suspected carcinogens), and Chloroform is particularly damaging to the environment. **Toluene** and **Dimethylformamide (DMF)** are also problematic due to their reproductive toxicity and other health hazards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Takeaway:** This simple computational tool empowers chemists to move beyond habit and make proactive, evidence-based decisions. By consulting a guide like this at the planning stage of an experiment, a researcher can easily identify and avoid the most problematic solvents, leading to inherently safer and more sustainable chemistry."
